# Photoelectric-effect
The photon theory of light states that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends purely on the frequency of the incident light, and is independent of the intensity. By testing the photoelectric effect it is evident that light acts as a particle rather than a wave. This was completed in the Fall of 2017.
